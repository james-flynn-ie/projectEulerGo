<h2>Running the solutions</h2>
<h3>Go Playground</h3>
<p>The Go Playground is a web service offered by golang.org.</p>

<p>Just copy the code from the main.go file in the solution into the code window on https://play.golang.org/, and then hit the 'Run' button.</p>

<h3>Command Line</h3>
<p>Alternatively, to run the solutions on your local machine (and assuming you have already installed Go from here: https://golang.org/doc/install), git clone the repo and then type the following in the src/solution/[problem_name] folder:

```
go run main.go
```
</p>

<h4>Enjoy!</h4>
