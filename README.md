[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/james-flynn-ie/projectEulerGo.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/james-flynn-ie/projectEulerGo) [![codebeat badge](https://codebeat.co/badges/16700183-8075-44b6-be22-321e02349a97)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-james-flynn-ie-projecteulergo-master)

## What is Project Euler?

`Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.`

_<https://projecteuler.net/about>_

The purpose of this repository is to share solutions to the [problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives), and to help each other improve as programmers by sharing solutions and suggesting ways to improve the code.

Feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/james-flynn-ie/projectEulerGo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## Running the solutions

### Go Playground

The Go Playground is a web service offered by golang.org.

Just copy the code from the main.go file in the solution you want to run into the code window on <https://play.golang.org/>, and then hit the 'Run' button.

### Command Line

Alternatively, to run the solutions on your local machine (and assuming you have already installed [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)), git clone the repo and then type the following in the src/solution/[problem_name] folder:

```go
go run main.go
```

## Have fun!
